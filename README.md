# Free Udemy Courses Web Scraper
A Python script for automatic redeeming of free Udemy courses.

## About this project

This is a personal project I developed to save time on redeeming free Udemy courses that were posted on a discounts/offers oriented forum named [Promodescuentos](https://www.promodescuentos.com/).

On this forum, users post coupons or items on discount. For Udemy, all posts were about free courses, either new free courses, fully discounted courses of 100% OFF coupons. Despite the method, the result was the same: a free Udemy course.

Suddenly, I found myself spending a considerable amount of time pressing the same buttons to redeem lots of Udemy courses. At some point, the progammer in me tought "I'm pretty sure a repetitive process like this can be automated", and although he was right, he forgot a little detail: I knew nothing about automating things.
After some investigation and coming across a very useful book ([Automating the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)), which of course I read completely and not only the parts I was interested in, I started working on this project.

To this day, with the help of this script I have "bought" 958 Udemy Courses, most of which I have never even read the title, but hey, they were free.
